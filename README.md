Module 15, Leaflet &amp; JS

This challenges uses Leaflet in JavaScript to map of earthquakes that have occured in the last 24 hours, as gathered by the U.S. Geological Survey via GeoJSON.

The map plots each earthquake; the intensity of color represents the increased intensity of the depth of the earthquake and the size of the radius is dependent upon the magnitude.
